# Project 1

Hi, My name is **Danesh Tolani** and I have completed the 1st Project of the iNeuron Full Stack Course.

The most challenging things were:

- Positioning the image on the grid image.
- Inserting the bottom border on the Home button in the navbar

It took me **5 Hours** to complete this project
